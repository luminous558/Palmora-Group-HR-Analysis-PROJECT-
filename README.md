This is my Second Case Study (Project) to work on as a Data Analyst during Incubator Hub Program


# $${\color{Aqua}INTRODUCTION}$$



In light of recent public scrutiny surrounding gender inequality at The Palmoria Group, a prominent manufacturing company based in Nigeria, the organization has found itself at a critical crossroads. A damning media headline, ‚ÄúPalmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy,‚Äù has not only cast a shadow over the company‚Äôs internal culture but also threatens its broader business ambitions, particularly its expansion into new regions and international markets.

The CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, has expressed deep concern about the implications of this negative press and the potential uncovering of systemic issues such as gender pay disparities and unequal growth opportunities. Determined to take swift and meaningful action, he has tasked the Chief Human Resources Officer, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, with spearheading a comprehensive review of the company‚Äôs HR practices through a gender equity lens.

In response, Mr. Shofoluwe has engaged the expertise of an HR Analytics professional to lead a strategic project aimed at uncovering and addressing gender-based disparities within the workforce. This initiative will involve an in-depth analysis of HR data across Palmoria‚Äôs three regional operations, with the goal of identifying areas of concern, highlighting patterns of inequality, and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

This project represents a pivotal step in restoring public trust, safeguarding the company‚Äôs reputation, and building a future where gender equality is not just a goal but a foundational principle of Palmoria‚Äôs organizational culture.


# $${\color{Aqua}OBJECTIVE \space \space STATEMENT}$$

The primary objective of this project is to identify, analyze, and address gender-related disparities within The Palmoria Group‚Äôs workforce across its three regional operations. By leveraging HR analytics, the project aims to support the company‚Äôs leadership in making informed, data-driven decisions that promote gender equality and foster a more inclusive organizational culture. Specifically, the objectives are to:

- **Diagnose existing gender imbalances** in recruitment, compensation, promotions, training, leadership representation, and employee turnover across all regions.

- **Assess the gender pay gap** by analyzing salary data across roles, departments, and seniority levels.

- **Evaluate policy and process gaps** that may contribute to systemic gender inequality, including hiring practices, performance evaluations, and career development opportunities.

- **Benchmark Palmoria‚Äôs performance** against industry standards and best practices in gender equity.

- **Generate actionable insights and recommendations** for leadership to implement sustainable strategies that promote gender equality.

- **Support reputational recovery** and reinforce the company‚Äôs commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly as Palmoria positions itself for expansion into new markets.

### üìå 2. **Address Pay Inequities**

And Prioritize corrections in high-gap departments like Accounting and Legal.


### üìå 3. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance**


Company should Review salaries below $90,000 and bring them up to meet legal requirements.

And Budget for phased adjustments in departments with many sub-threshold earners.

and Company should Communicate changes transparently to foster trust and accountability.


### üìå 4. **Improve Performance Evaluation Fairness**


Campany needs to Review and recalibrate rating systems to reduce subjectivity.

And Introduce 360-degree feedback mechanisms to ensure diverse input in evaluations.

Company should Track rating trends by gender to detect and correct systemic bias.


### üìå 5. **Redesign Bonus Structure (Optional Enhancement)**


Tying bonuses partly to team or department goals to reduce individual performance bias should well monitored by the Organization

# üß© $${\color{Aqua}PROJECT \space \space CONCLUSION}$$



The gender inequality concerns raised at The Palmoria Group are not only valid but also supported by clear data patterns across regions and departments. The analysis has revealed systemic issues ‚Äî including gender imbalance in workforce distribution, disparities in performance ratings, and a persistent gender pay gap ‚Äî particularly concentrated in key operational areas like Accounting and Legal.

Furthermore, compliance risks have been identified, as a significant number of employees currently earn below the newly mandated minimum salary threshold of $90,000. These gaps in pay, performance evaluation, and compensation allocation pose not just internal culture challenges, but also reputational and legal risks, especially as Palmoria positions itself for international expansion.

However, this also presents a unique opportunity for the organization to lead by example. With a data-driven roadmap now in place, Palmoria can take decisive steps toward fostering an inclusive, equitable, and future-ready workplace. By implementing the recommended strategies ‚Äî from targeted hiring and pay adjustments to performance review reforms and compliance checks ‚Äî leadership can rebuild trust, improve employee morale, and reposition Palmoria as a forward-thinking employer of choice.

The path to gender equity at Palmoria begins with action ‚Äî and the data has made the next steps clear.
